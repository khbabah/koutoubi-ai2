# Foreword 

Given the importance of English in today's world, the 1999 reform of the Mauritanian educational system introduced English in junior high school. The Mauritanian Government, through the Ministry of National Education and Educational System Reform, has made this decision to meet the growing needs of the learners to master the English language for their personal, social, emotional, physical, educational, and professional purposes. Thus, the secondary school curricula were re-written in August-September, 2020 based on the holistic approach, which puts the learner at the heart of its interests and focuses on everything the learner needs to know to be able to communicate effectively. In other words, this approach seeks to engage all aspects of the learner, including mind, body, and spirit.

We hope that this textbook meets an interest in the learner and contributes to the acquisition process so thatyou, the students, get to level up your motivation in learning English.

Dear teachers, we hope that you enjoy using this book with your motivated learners, and help inspire and re-shape their way of thinking and acting, through the different activities and class projects proposed by the book and others that you might come up with as you design and give your lessons.
