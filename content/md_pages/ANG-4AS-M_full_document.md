# Foreword 

Given the importance of English in today's world, the 1999 reform of the Mauritanian educational system introduced English in junior high school. The Mauritanian Government through the Ministry of National Education and Educational System Reform has made this decision to meet the growing needs of the learners to master the English language for their personal, educational, social and professional purposes. Thus, the secondary school curricula were re-written in August-September 2020, based on the holistic approach, which puts the learner at the heart of its interests and focuses on everything the learner needs to know to be able to communicate effectively. In other words, this approach seeks to engage all aspects of the learner, including mind, body, and spirit.

We hope that this textbook meets an interest in the learner and contributes to the acquisition process so that you, the students, get to level up your motivation in learning English.

Dear teachers, we hope that you enjoy using this book with your motivated learners; and help inspire and re-shape their way of thinking and acting.

The general director of the IPN
Houda Babah

# UNITFOUR 

## Global Warming

## 1. I learn how to describe actions.

## 2. I look and read.

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)
"Global warming" is defined as a gradual increase in the earth's temperature generally due to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide ... and other pollutants. And it is leading to unexpected climate change. This change happens faster than man could expect.

There are some natural factors that badly influence the earth's climate. These factors include external influences such as explosive volcanic eruptions which frequently happen in some places, natural variations in the output of the sun ...

With temperature records being relatively smashed month after month, year after year, it's likely that human activities made global warming easily seen in numerous phenomena such as extreme heat events. Higher temperatures also boost evaporation, which dries out the soil in summer - intensifying drought over many areas. Results of this terrible development become more dangerous than ever before, and can be obviously observed in some aspects like:

- First, heavy rains and floods in some countries.
- Second, a decrease in water quantity in rivers and lakes.
- Third a drought over many areas in the world.
- Fourth, an increase of heavy wind and cyclones.
- And then what is known as "increased extreme weather patterns."

# UNIT FIVE 

## Man and Means of Transportation

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)

## Text

Since the early ages of his life, man has known various means of transportation. The first means of transportation was the human foot. People used to walk long distances to reach places. The first improvement made to this kind of transportation was adapting to different surfaces. Ages later, man developed new ways; he used to train some animals like camels, horses, cows, donkeys, elephants... to be used as means of transportation. But, since the wheel came into existence, people experienced more advanced techniques. They used to take carts driven by trained animals, thus, making long distance journeys easier and faster.

The means of transportation used today are a result of bitter human experiences. Surely, the advent of wheels has been a great revolution. One of its fruits consisted in the use of carts and carriages. Whereas the invention of cars and buses as means of roadways came into existence much later. In the 17th and 18th centuries, man could invent the means of transportation used today on roadways like the cycle, motor cars, trucks etc. The first car with internal combustion was produced in 1906; this technique today is the basis of many trains and cars.

Nowadays, people are very lucky because they have well advanced and more comfortable means of transportion, on roadways, sea, and space.

In a country where only limited number of hospitals, primary healthcare facilities of specialized centres were fully functional after the earthquake, this earthquake will result in a further collapse of basic services, and significantly delay any scope for recovery."

A United Nations' representative in the region said that this population [was] already highly vulnerable. They have a huge number of people who have already been displaced ... Almost the majority of them are women and children, particularly vulnerable to the harsh weather and this earthquake."Many people around the world were shocked and felt very sad when watching reports about the terrible results of this catastrophe.

## Sport Activities

## 1. I learn how to express frequency.

## 2. I look and read.

![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)

## Text:

No matter your age, it is important to frequently make sport, to take part in sport and fitness activities on a regular basis. Of course, it becomes more important to stay active in our older years in order to stay fit and healthy. People usually select some sports activities, according to their age, gender, health...

Young people always tend to exercise vigorous intensity exercise like: football, boxing, tennis, jogging/running, swimming fast....And rarely exercise moderate aerobic sports such as: cycling, volleyball...Whereas, most older practice frequently light activities like: cleaning and dusting around the home, walking at a slow pace, and moving around your home (getting up to make a cup of tea, for example). But, a lot of elders over the age of 65 often spend several hours a day sitting or lying down. This lack of activity is causing serious health problems for many older people. A lack of activity can cause reduced mobility, leading to aches and pains when doing simple things such as walking to the shops. On the other hand, people who remain active have a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes...So, old people rarely use vigorous intensive sports. They prefer activities like: cycling, walking...
