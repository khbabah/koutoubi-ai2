# Foreword 

Given the importance of English in today's world, the 1999 reform of the Mauritanian educational system introduced English in junior high school. The Mauritanian Government through the Ministry of National Education and Educational System Reform has made this decision to meet the growing needs of the learners to master the English language for heir personal, social, emotional, physical, educational, and professional purposes. Thus, the secondary school curricula were rewritten in August -September, 2020 based on the holistic approach, which puts the learner at the heart of its interests and focuses on everything the learnerneeds to know to communicate effectively. In other words, this approach seeks to engage all aspects of the learner, including mind, body, and spirit.

We hope that this textbook meets an interest in the learner and contributes to the acquisition process so that you the students, get to level up your motivation in learning English.

Dear teachers, we hope that you enjoy using this book with your motivated learners, and help inspire and re-shape their way of thinking and acting.

THE GENERAL DIRECTOR CHEIKH OULD AHMEDOU

I have twin brothers, Ousmane and Abou. They're 14 years old and although they're twins, they aren't identical twins because they are different in many ways. They are not alike. Look at their picture; Ousmane is the one with curly hair and snub nose, and he's quite tall, but, Abou isn't very tall and he's got black hair and dark eyes. Also, they never wear the same clothes. Ousmane always wears suits while Abou is almost always seen in tee shirts and jeans.

Both of them are always very kind to me, their little sister. I can tell them all my problems. Have you seen me in the picture? I'm the little girl in the pink dress.
